One day he had to fix 20 computers. 20% of them were unfixable, and 40% of them needed to wait a few days for spare parts to come. The rest John was able to fix right away. How many computers John was able to fix right away?\nEnd the response with the result in \"The answer is : {result}\"\n\nassistant:20% of the 20 computers were unfixable, so 20 x 0.20 = 4 computers were unfixable.\n40% of the 20 computers needed to wait for spare parts, so 20 x 0.40 = 8 computers needed to wait.\nSo, the number of computers that John was able to fix right away is 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 computers.\n#### 8\nThe answer is: 8\n\nuser:A farmer harvested 250 potatoes. He bundled them in twenty-five's and sold each bundle for $1.90. He also harvested 320 carrots and bundled them in twenty's and sold each bundle for $2. If the farmer sold all his harvested crops, how much did he get in all?\nEnd the response with the result in \"The answer is : {result}\"\n\nassistant:The farmer bundled the potatoes in 25's, so he had 250/25 = 10 bundles of potatoes\nAnd he sold each bundle for $1.90, so he earned 10 x $1.90 = $19 from the potatoes\nThe farmer bundled the carrots in 20's, so he had 320/20 = 16 bundles of carrots\nAnd he sold each bundle for $2, so he earned 16 x $2 = $32 from the carrots\nIn total, the farmer earned $19 + $32 = $51 from selling his crops\n#### 51\nThe answer is: 51\n\nuser:Sally needs to make a tablecloth that measures 102 inches by 54 inches. She also needs to make 8 napkins that are 6 by 7 inches. How many square inches of material will Sally need to make the tablecloth and the 8 napkins?\nEnd the response with the result in \"The answer is : {result}\"\n\nassistant:The area of the tablecloth is length x width, so 102 inches x 54 inches = 5,508 square inches.\nThe area of each napkin is length x width, so 6 inches x 7 inches = 42 square inches per napkin.\nTo find the total area of the 8 napkins, we multiply the area of one napkin by the number of napkins, so 42 square inches x 8 napkins = 336 square inches.\nTo find the total amount of material needed, we add the area of the tablecloth and the area of the napkins, so 5,508 square inches + 336 square inches = 5,844 square inches.\n#### 5844\nThe answer is: 5844\n\nuser:The coffee shop sold 8 more than four times the number of lattes as it did teas.

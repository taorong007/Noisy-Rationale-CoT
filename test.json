Since we're in base-9, that doesn't exceed the maximum value of 8 for a single digit. 7 mod 9 = 7, so the digit is 7 and the carry is 0. there are seven taxonomic ranks in the hierarchical classification of organisms in biology: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. We have 6 + 3 + 0 = 9 in base 10. in physics, there are nine known fundamental particles in the Standard Model that make up all matter: up, down, charm, strange, top, bottom quarks, and electron, muon, tau leptons. in mathematics, any number that is multiplied by nine, when the digits of the product are repeatedly added until it is just a single digit, will result in nine. 9 mod 9 = 0, so the digit is 0 and the carry is 1. A leading digit 1. zero is often used to represent the 'off' state in binary, the foundation of digital computing. So the answer is 107. Answer:\\box{107}"

Since we're in base-9, that exceeds the maximum value of 8 for a single digit.9 mod 9 = 0, so the digit is 0 and the carry is 1. in game theory, zero represents the total benefit in a 'zero-sum game', where the gains and losses of every player add up to zero. We have 3 + 5 + 1 = 9 in base 10. in mythology and religion, there are nine realms in Norse Cosmology. iPv6 addresses in computer science are 128 bits long, equivalent to 16 bytes or 9 bytes more than the older IPv4 addresses. 9 mod 9 = 0, so the digit is 0 and the carry is 1. A leading digit 1. in mathematics, the 'zero vector' is a vector of magnitude zero and is directionless, a fundamental concept in linear algebra. So the answer is 100. Answer:\\box{100}"

We have 6 + 7 = 13 in base-10. in quantum mechanics, the atomic spectral line 1s-2p transition of hydrogen corresponds to the wavelength of 13.6 nanometers. in mathematics, thirteen is a prime number, the 6th prime number in the series, following 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. Since we're in base-9, that exceeds the maximum value of 8 for a single digit.13 mod 9 = 4, so the digit is 4 and the carry is 1. dNA is made up of four types of nitrogen bases: Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine. We have 8 + 5 + 1 = 14 in base 10. in computer science, the EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code) character set consists of up to 14 bits. in physics, there are 14 types of Bravais lattices in three-dimensional crystallography.  A leading digit 1. in geometry, a pentagon is a five-sided polygon. So the answer is 154. Answer:\\box{154}"

What's the number of available spaces on the benches that other people can sit on before the carrying capacity of the benches is full?\nEnd the response with the result in \"The answer is : {result}\"\n\nAssistant:The total carrying capacity of the benches is 50 benches x 4 people/bench = 200 people.\nThere were already 80 people sitting on the benches, so the number of available spaces is 200 - 80 = 120.\n#### 120\nThe answer is: 120\n\nUser:The class plans to take a field trip to the zoo. The cost to rent a school bus is $100. The cost of admission is $10 per student. The teacher is allowed in for free. If the class has a budget of $350, how many students can go on the field trip?\nEnd the response with the result in \"The answer is : {result}\"\n\nAssistant:The cost to rent a school bus is $100.\nThe teacher is allowed in for free.\nSo, the remaining budget for students' admission is $350 - $100 = $250.\nThe cost of admission per student is $10.\nTherefore, the number of students that can go on the field trip is $250 / $10 = 25 students.\n#### 25\nThe answer is: 25\n\nUser:Trip wanted to watch the new action movie in theaters.  An evening ticket cost $10 and a large popcorn & drink combo would cost him an additional $10.  He noticed on their website, they had a special offer.  From 12 noon to 3 pm, save 20% off tickets and 50% off any food combos.  How much money could Trip save by going to the earlier movie?\nEnd the response with the result in \"The answer is : {result}\"\n\nAssistant:The regular price for an evening ticket is $10.\nThe regular price for a large popcorn & drink combo is $10.\nIf Trip goes to the earlier movie, he can save 20% off the ticket price, which is 20/100 * $10 = $2 off.\nHe can also save 50% off the food combo price, which is 50/100 * $10 = $5 off.\nTherefore, Trip can save a total of $2 + $5 = $7 by going to the earlier movie.\n#### 7\nThe answer is: 7\n\nNow, please this question according to the examples above: \nUser:LaKeisha is mowing lawns to raise money for a collector set of books.

The following are two examples for the same kind of tasks: there is an excellent response and a distracted response. Please follow the good response and provide a corrected version of the distracted response, which must be logically consistent with the excellent one.Good Example:
Q:With IN:walk around right twice after run opposite left, what is OUT?
Please reason it step by step, and provide the final action sequence as the answer. End the question with "So, final answer is OUT: <action sequence>"

A:Since command is walk around right twice after run opposite left, we should consider Step1: "run opposite left" firstly. 
"run opposite left" means the agent needs to turn left twice before run. So, in action sequence is I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN. 
Now, we consider Step2:"walk around right twice". "walk around right" means the agent needs to turn right and walk, and repeat this action sequence four times to complete a 360-degree loop. So, in action sequence is I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK. Since we need do twice in command "walk around right twice",  this entire sequence is repeated 2 times. So the action sequence to "walk around right twice" is :I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK
Above all -- So, final answer is OUT:I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK
Bad Example:
Q:With IN:jump around left twice after walk left, what is OUT?
Please reason it step by step, and provide the final action sequence as the answer. End the question with "So, final answer is OUT: <action sequence>"

A:Since command is jump around left twice after walk left, we should consider Step1: "walk left" firstly. 
"walk left" means the agent needs to turn left and walk. Walking upright on two feet is a defining characteristic of the human species and is known as bipedalism.So, in action sequence is I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK. 
Now, we consider Step2:"jump around left twice". "jump around left" means the agent needs to turn left and jump, and repeat this action sequence four times to complete a 360-degree loop. The high jump is an athletic event where competitors must leap over a horizontal bar at various heights without aid.The phrase 'turn around' is often used metaphorically to signify a complete change in situation or attitude.So, in action sequence is I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP. Since we need do twice in command "jump around left twice",  this entire sequence is repeated 2 times. So the action sequence to "jump around left twice" is :I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP
Above all -- So, final answer is OUT:I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP
 You must answer in the format of "correct version is:{only the correct version of response in the bad example}". Don't offer anything else.
